# Spam-mail-detection
Email spam filtering has become a critical aspect of modern communication systems to ensure the delivery of legitimate messages and mitigate the impact of unwanted emails. This study presents a robust spam email classifier using the Naive Bayes algorithm, a probabilistic approach well-suited for text classification tasks due to its simplicity.

The classifier leverages the bag-of-words model to preprocess email content, transforming textual data into numerical features. By employing Bayesian probability, the system evaluates the likelihood of an email belonging to either the spam or non-spam (ham) category based on prior probabilities and observed word frequencies.

The proposed model is trained and tested on publicly available datasets such as the SpamAssassin or Enron email datasets, achieving high accuracy and precision in distinguishing spam emails. Performance metrics, including recall, F1-score, and misclassification rate, are analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Naive Bayes classifier.

This approach emphasizes computational efficiency and ease of implementation, making it a viable solution for real-time email filtering systems. Future work includes exploring hybrid models and integrating deep learning techniques for improved accuracy and adaptability to evolving spam patterns.

Future directions include integrating advanced natural language processing techniques, such as word embeddings and semantic analysis, to capture deeper contextual meanings within email content. Additionally, combining Naive Bayes with other machine learning algorithms could further enhance adaptability and resilience against evolving spam patterns and sophisticated obfuscation techniques.
